# Streamera

This repo aims to build an android app to stream phone camera feed to a computer using sockets.

## Installation:
Download the file at [link](https://github.com/SubZer0811/streamera/blob/main/app-debug.apk) on to your android phone and install it on your phone.

## Running (app (client)):
Run the app on your phone. Enter the correct server IP and PORT and press connect.

## Running (server):
Run the following command on your computer.

**TODO**:
  - Change sockets from TCP to something better
  - Add functionality to stream through Serial communication
